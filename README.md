# Type Mismatch Bug in TypeScript
This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript where an array is passed to a function expecting a string.  The error occurs because the types are incompatible.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version.

This is a simple example, but it highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and demonstrates how type mismatches can lead to runtime errors.  The solution showcases two common approaches to fix the problem: changing the function's argument type or modifying the function's logic to handle arrays appropriately.
